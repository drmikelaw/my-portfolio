## Deploying to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (quickest)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in (or create a free account).
2. From your dashboard, click **"Add new site" → "Deploy manually"**.
3. Drag the entire `my-portfolio` folder onto the upload area.
4. Netlify deploys instantly. Your site will be live at a generated URL (e.g., `random-name.netlify.app`).
5. To use a custom domain, go to **Site settings → Domain management**.

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub (recommended for ongoing updates)

1. **Push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   cd my-portfolio
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
   # Create a new repo on github.com, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Log in to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
   - Click **"Add new site" → "Import an existing project"**.
   - Choose **GitHub** and authorize Netlify.
   - Select your repository.
   - Build settings are automatically read from `netlify.toml`:
     - **Publish directory:** `.` (repository root)
     - No build command needed.
   - Click **Deploy site**.

3. **Automatic deployments**
   - Every push to `main` triggers a new deployment automatically.

## Netlify Forms

The contact form on `contact.html` uses Netlify Forms — no backend or server required.

- Form submissions appear in your Netlify dashboard under **Forms**.
- To receive email notifications: go to **Site settings → Forms → Form notifications** and add your email.
- Spam protection is built in via the honeypot field included in the form.

**How it works:** The hidden `<form name="contact" netlify netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>` element tells Netlify's build bot to register the form. The visible form POSTs to Netlify's form endpoint. The JavaScript in `js/main.js` handles the AJAX submission and shows a success message without a page reload.

## Adding Your Photo

Replace the photo placeholder in `index.html`:

1. Add your headshot to `assets/images/` (recommended: `headshot.jpg`, square crop, at least 400×400px).
2. In `index.html`, find the `<div class="hero__photo">` block and replace it:

```html
<div class="hero__photo">
  <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Dr. Mike Law" />
</div>
```
